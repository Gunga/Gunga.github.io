        <h2>Pairing &amp; Feedback</h2>

        <p>
          Pairing with others to solve challenges has been interesting. Some of the challenges we face during normal pair programing sessions seem easier to solve because we work freely. Our aim is to understand and solve an issue in order to move on. It's always fun to see how other people focus on a problem and what they come up with. I guess one of the most important parts of pairing is the improvement for both sides once the session is over. If the driver is the one who writes the code and the navigator the one who sort of "directs" the solution, then the driver learns from the navigator's experience and point of view which helps the driver grow while learning from someone else or someone else's approach. Similarly, the navigator learns to understand his approach better in order to be able to explain it to the driver. The whole experience can turn out to be very rewarding for both. So far, that has been my experience. I haven't had any difficult or frustrating moments beyond the sharing of the collaborative programming sites not working properly. When that happens there's always screen sharing. Another import part of pair programming is feedback.

          Feedback can a really helpful tool for people working in a collaborative environment such as in the world of software development. The first time I read some of my feedback I felt pretty good because the feedback was really useful. I learned about how people felt working with me as well as what I did right that I didn't even know I could've done wrong or differently. I tend to receive a lot of thanks for being very thorough and clear with any explanations I need to make. I have to keep that up, because in my last few sessions that changed a bit. My peers felt I needed to slow down or explain a bit more which probably had nothing to with them but with my state at the time of pairing. During those first sessions I let go the world and focus. My weeks have gotten increasingly hectic so the last few sessions had me rushing, hungry, tired or facing connectivity problems. Now, if I'm receiving feedback that's because my peers have give me such, therefore I have to return the favor and give them some feedback.

          Writing feedback for others is a terrifying. There is so much that can go wrong in writing feedback that it's almost impossible not to hesitate or procrastinate. Writing feedback that is specific, actionable while being kind and anonymous is almost like a social experiment that got out of control. It's definitely not easy, because you had rapport and a nice time working with someone and then you have to scrutinize your session in order to help both of you grow as professionals. In the end, I guess we just have to be honest and make sure we don't confuse being kind with being nice when we write our feedback. Pairing and feedback is a neat way to learn more and grow as a professional. We get nearly-instant results from each session. What we learn depends on the challenge, but the growth is there nonetheless.
