        <h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
        <p>According to my test results from <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this quiz</a> regarding Gregorc Thiking Styles. I lean towards the <strong>Concrete Random</strong> spectrum.</p>

        <p>As me, you may wonder what the heck does that even mean. Well, after researching a bit about these thinking styles I found some common adjectives used to describe a Concrete Random thinker:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Experimenter</li>
          <li>Creative</li>
          <li>Self-Directed</li>
          <li>Divergent</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That rang true to me. I enjoy experimenting, solving problems creatively with a hands-on approach, taking risks, following what I find interesting, and seeing as many options to solve a problem. However, at first I didn't really think much of that description because in a way it felt generic and a bit similar to many astrology readings. That is until I reached the point where I learned about the struggles of a Concrete Random thinker:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Being told what to do and how to do it</li>
          <li>Being told it can't be done</li>
          <li>Strict, inflexible routines</li>
          <li>Formalities, formal reports, pomp, fads</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>OUCH!</strong><br>Well, as much as it may hurt, those, as well as other similar ones, rang rather true to me. During this Phase 0 of DBC, if there's something I've struggled with is following a set of steps or requirements, specially when I consider them unnecessary. My other big struggle has been the "reflections" we have to do after MOST challenges (average of 8 per week I think, so this being week 3, we're talking about 24 reflections... sheesh). All of these are formalities and they seem to follow some pretty strict guidelines. This has probably been THE hardest part for me to accept during Phase 0.</p>

        <p>I recently also learned about <a href="http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/">Fixed and Growth Mindset</a>. I believe that I am a Growth Mindset individual because I embrace challenges because I believe in effort as the path to mastery. Believing too much in raw talent seems to be the perfect way to stay within the same proficiency level. Perhaps this is my Concrete Random side speaking for me but I believe I can figure out how to deal with my struggles. Specially now that I've become aware of them thanks to this test and following up with research. I will definitely always avoid any kind of inflexible routine or ostentatious formality. That's seems to be hardwired into me. However, that doesn't mean I won't be able to pretend for a little while that those are normal to me.</p>
