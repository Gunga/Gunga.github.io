            <h2>An Improvisational Journey</h2>
            <p>Welcome,<br>my name is Joan Torres and this is a special lesson on how to begin understanding musical improvistation.</p>

            <p>Musical improvisation is a wonderful thing. However, there are many listeners as well as novice performers who don't necessarily understand the depths of improvisation. This usually leads to a lot of confusion determining what works and what doesn't. Some soloists amaze with a few notes and others with many. None are better than the other, they are just different. However, by diving into what improvising entails we can begin to discover what it is that we enjoy about our favorite performers.</p>

            <h3>Before Improvisation</h3>
            <p>We can begin this journey with music before improvisation. As far as we know, primitive music did not necessarily achieve a high level of musicianship. It is believe that most primitive music was mainly used in rites and ceremonies. The experience was perhaps more about connecting with the spiritual rather than displaying skill or telling a story. However, as time went on music became more common in different sort of activities. Musicians needed a way to communicate accurately which is why eventually a standard notation system was developed.</p>

            <p>The creation of a standard musical notation meant rules were set in place so music could now be preserved on paper. This meant learning a song or a musical piece was slightly easier as long as you understood the notation. Therefore, music began to grow. Traditions were set, challenged and elaborated on. The simpler traditions from Medieval and Renaissance periods were expanded on through Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods. It is through these periods that music begins slowly shifting from a mostly-church-oriented activity to an artform the masses enjoy.</p>


            <h3>Early Improvisation</h3>
            <p>During the more Baroque period there were many concepts musical concepts such as tonality and many techniques developed to enrich music. Most music aimed at displaying virtuosity and thus improvisation was a highly valued skill. However, with the exception of certain musical sections such as <em>candenzas</em> or preludes, the performer was mostly still performing what the composers had written. Notable composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonio Vivaldi lived in this period. These composers would have jobs as main composers for a church or an emperor at the time. Therefore, most of their compositions were ordered. However, during the time of transition between the Baroque period and the Classical period Wolgang Amadeus Mozart was born.</p>

            <p>Notable for having acquired a high level of proficiency in music at a very young age, Mozart defied many rules and became a prolific and influential composer. Mozart loved composing music. He had so many ideas he would keep on writing music that no one even ordered him to write. This practice was considered odd since he wouldn't necessarily ever be able to hear what he wrote until an orchestra performed it and that would've only been possible if his composition was allowed to be presented to the public. However, as a child Mozart had acquired the ability we now call "perfect pitch", which means he could recall a note by ear without any prior tonal reference. He could listen to an orchestra and know exactly which notes everyone was playing just by listening. So when it came to composing he was compelled to write music as he heard it in his head and as he <em>KNEW</em> it would sound when performed. His musical experience was a very personal one. As music slowly begins to become more personal, so does improvisation.</p>

            <h3>Taking Off</h3>
            <p>During earlier periods of music, the composer was the heart of the music. What you could hear was his idea and the image he was trying to convey. During any improvisational sections the performer had certain rules, ideas or motifs to follow. He couldn't roam free or else he would lose the composer's original idea. Instruments such as the piano became more common during later periods. Composers would write concertos featuring only a pianist. Composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Chopin and Franz Liszt would write many musical works featuring only piano which they would also perform. Their virtuoso skills as well as their musical proficiency led to them having many personal compositions with prominent use of improvisation. However, it wasn't until the 20th century when a musical group could succesfully perform together having improvisation be a central role of their collective performance.


            <h3>All That Jazz</h3>
            <p>As music kept on growing, it became even more accesible to the public. Many could learn to play a musical instrument and music became pervasive in people's lives. The musical genre we now know as Blues features heavy use of improvisation. This kind was mostly based around a set of agreed-upon chord changes and the use of your ear to figure out what to play next. Blues slowly branched out into what became Jazz music. During this period Jazz players began to explore many of the possible changes as well as notes that could work while improvising. As a result, different styles and approaches to group improvisation began to grow.</p>
